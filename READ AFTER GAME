I feel the need to disclaim that Barry the Chopper is technically from the manga FMA. The story in this escape room is not related to the original Barry the Chopper in anyway. I just thought it'd be funny to use him as the serial killer. (This is Barry, and he's fantastic. https://pa1.narvii.com/7308/b809de432ea3decc121b44cddf25b571b80580ddr1-500-258_hq.gif)

I also deny all use of logic in this game. Why did the front door collapse? Why is the plant not dead? How can Barry get inside if the door collapsed? Why is Donald Duck even in this story? I don't know either. I don't know what proper plot is.

Speaking of plot, if it didn't make sense, cubicle 2 belonged to Barry back when he was employed in the office. Cubicle 3 was his friend's, also known as the beloved Ronald McDonald. Barry thought he was going to be promoted. But instead, Ronald wins Best Employee of the Year, and Barry gets nothing. This makes Barry very sad, and so he kills everyone. The end.

I also originally intended to include a time limit, but it didn't really work so that's not there. Sorry.
